## Overview
I created a Crystal Collector game where in order to win the player must try to score the same points as the random number generated. The user scores points by selecting cystals which have point values assigned to them.



## Full Game Break Down
*This is a guessing game using numbers where the player will guess with numbers.
*There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
*The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
*When the player clicks on a crystal it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
*The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.
*The amount of points each crystal adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.
*The number of games won and lost will be displayed.
*If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss.
*The game will restart once either the player wins or losses.
*When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.
